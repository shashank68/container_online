A container is a standard unit of cloud software that packages up code and all its related dependencies. Hence, the application runs faster and reliably across various
computing environments Microservice architecture is an architectural style that
structures an application as a collection of services that are easily maintainable and
testable, loosely related on other software functionalities within the software and
also independently deployable. Cloud computing with big data on traditional
Virtual Machines architecture was inefficient and was flexible. Containers and
Microservices help developers to manage and easily build self-operating
microservices-based applications. Microservices contain many things such as
platform, framework, runtime dependencies, all encapsulated into a single unit of
execution. Containers pack all the discrete components of service logic with
minimal resources to complete the assigned task. A microservice can run on a
container as well as on a virtual machine. Containers act as building blocks that
can be used to run an application on the cloud. Containerisation is Operating
System-level virtualisation. Containers though isolate applications from each other,
providing additional security to the application. Containers do not need any
specific infrastructure to operate. It can run on any computer or any other cloud for
that matter. Containers with microservices, on the other hand are more flexible and
efficient in space usage, power usage and have very few dependencies. This makes
processing large amounts of data easier by employing workload sharing across
microservices run on containers. These containers can be moved across hardware
with minimum dependencies.
